House Price Prediction - Data Science

## Theme

For this Machine Learning project #2, I have the task of predicting housing prices, for this it will be determined if a house price is 'Low' or not, that is, if it is economical or not.

Since the real estate market is a fundamental part of society and the current economy, it is very interesting to be able to try to predict the price with certain variables that we have, for example: number of rooms, number of bathrooms, area of the home, location, parking. , among several others.

The idea is to be able to predict with these variables if the price of a property is less than 1000, it will be categorized as "low", that is, economical. And if not, it would be categorized as not economical.

With this we can draw a lot of conclusions and do many exercises, for example if we want to invest in a property and we want to know if the price of a certain property is in accordance with its characteristics, we can evaluate this by comparing its price with that of our model, and so on. continue doing many exercises on a daily basis that can be useful to both an individual and a company.

For this I will use a Machine Learning model where the model is trained with a specific file, that is, it already has real prices, and then download the data in CSV form and predict future prices.
